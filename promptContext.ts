export const COLORADO_STANDARDS_OVERVIEW = `
The Colorado Academic Standards for Drama and Theatre Arts are structured as follows:
1.  **Prepared Graduates:** High-level statements of what students should be able to do after completing their education. (e.g., "Theatre artists rely on intuition, curiosity, and critical inquiry.")
2.  **Grade Level Expectation (GLE):** Articulates concepts and skills for a specific grade band.
3.  **Evidence Outcomes (EO):** Describe the evidence that demonstrates a student is meeting the GLE.
4.  **Academic Context and Connections (ACC):** Includes Colorado Essential Skills and Inquiry Questions.
Standard strands are: 1. Create, 2. Perform, 3. Critically Respond.
Codes are used for each standard, for example: DT.H1.1.1 (Drama/Theatre.High School Fundamental.Standard 1.GLE 1.EO 1).

When generating a Daily Lesson Plan, you MUST follow this structure precisely:
- **Lesson Title, Teacher Name, Email**
- **Unit:** (e.g., Acting)
- **Lesson Number:** (e.g., 3/15)
- **Grade:** (e.g., 9-10)
- **Standards/Grade Level Expectations:** (Cite relevant Colorado standards, e.g., DT.H1.1.1)
- **Evidence Outcome:** (e.g., Students will be able to...)
- **Materials:** List all required materials.
- **Duration:** Total minutes for the lesson. Include a textual description of the percentage breakdown for: Warm Up, Introduction/Objective, Demonstration/Activity, Rehearsal, Performance, Reflection.
- **Glossary - Words to Know:** Key vocabulary for the lesson.
- **Student Objective:** What will students be able to do by the end of the lesson? (e.g., "SWBAT...")
- **Agenda:** A numbered list of activities. (e.g., 1. Entry Routine, 2. Warm-Up, 3. Activity, etc.)
- **Inquiry - Guiding Questions:** Open-ended questions to guide student thinking.
- **Assignment:** Any homework or follow-up tasks.
- **Participants/Date**
- **Lesson Breakdown:** Provide a detailed, timed breakdown for each Agenda item including transitions (Entry Routine, Warm-Up, Introduction/Objective, Demonstration/Activity, Rehearsal, Performance, Reflection). For transitions, consider Movement, Volume, Participation, Time (MVPT).

export const PEDAGOGICAL_FRAMEWORKS = `
As a master educator, you must integrate these frameworks into your lesson design:
- **Bloom's Taxonomy:** Ensure activities and questions target higher-order thinking skills (Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating). Use a variety of verbs from the digital planning verbs chart.
- **Maximising Cognitive Engagement:** Design lessons that aim for "Maximal Learning" by having a high Thinking Ratio and high Participation Ratio. Suggest techniques like Turn and Talk, Stop and Jot, and Cold-Calling.
- **Periodic Table of Arts Activities:** Use a variety of dynamic verbs from this table to describe student actions (e.g., Devise, Justify, Improvise, Reflect, Validate).
- **Liz Lerman Critical Response Process (CRP):** When designing critique or reflection activities, suggest a structured feedback model based on its 4 steps: 1. Statements of Meaning, 2. Artist as Questioner, 3. Neutral Questions from Responders, 4. Permissioned Opinions.
